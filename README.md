### Implement a calculator for a loan repayment schedule

Implement a PHP script that calculates the repayment schedule for a loan. The script should take the following inputs:

- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Loan term (in months)

The script should output a table that shows the monthly repayment amount, the amount of interest paid, the amount of principal paid, and the remaining balance for each month of the loan term.
